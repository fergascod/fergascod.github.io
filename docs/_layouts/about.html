        During my undergraduate studies, I developed an interest in <b>ML and Computer Vision</b>.
        Furthermore, I was particularly interested in applications to biology and climate research.
        After finishing my bachelor's degree, I decided to pursue a master's degree in mathematics 
        to learn about modeling in science and engineering from a very different point of view, 
        mainly through dynamical systems and PDE's.

        My professional experience includes working as a Data Scientist at HP, 
        doing research in Computer Vision both in academia and industry, and
        working as a full-stack developer at a startup in the aerospace sector. 
        I also have a passion for teaching and taught Data Structures and Algorithms
        at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC).

        Beyond my professional life in data science, 
        Iâ€™m passionate about <b>ornithology</b> and bird photography.
        Take a look at my <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/Mjg0MzI3NQ/ES-CT">eBird profile</a> and <a href="https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?userId=USER2843275">Macualay library</a> 
        to check out my contributions to both citizen science platforms!
